# Binary Tree Project

Welcome to the Binary Tree Project repository! This project is part of [Course Name] and involves implementing various algorithms and data structures related to binary trees in the C programming language.

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the concepts of binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversal methods, and different types of binary trees. The goal is to gain a solid understanding of these concepts and their practical applications through hands-on coding.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, we aim to:

- Explain binary tree and binary search tree concepts.
- Understand and implement binary tree traversal methods.
- Differentiate between various types of binary trees.
- Develop C code following the Betty style guidelines.
- Demonstrate the application of binary tree algorithms.

## Project Features

- Implementation of basic binary tree structures and operations.
- Exploration of traversal methods: inorder, preorder, and postorder.
- Comparison between binary trees and binary search trees.
- Understanding complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.
- Usage of the Betty style for coding consistency.
- Header file `binary_trees.h` with function prototypes.

## Requirements

- All code is compiled using gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Follow the Betty style guidelines for code formatting.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Use the standard library where necessary.
